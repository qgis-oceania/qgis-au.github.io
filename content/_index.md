The QGIS AU group was established in 2017 with the main objective to support QGIS users throughout Australia.

We have an active online discussion group and our mission is to engage and grow our community.

Made up of end-users, hobbyists, scientists, professionals, students and developers, all are welcome and we recognise the importance of everyone's input.
