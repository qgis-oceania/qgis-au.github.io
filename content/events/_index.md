**When:** 9am-5pm, Monday 4th November 2024 prior to the FOSS4G Oceania Conference, Hobart  
**Venue:** IMAS, UTAS, 20 Castray Esplanade, Battery Point TAS 7004  
**Tickets:** $10 AVAILABLE NOW. Only 40 will be available - click [here](https://ti.to/osgeo-oceania/qgis-au-2024) to order yours!  
**Updates:** We will publish details as they come. So check back here, or watch for updates on the QGIS AU email list and on Slack Maptime Oceania #qgis chat.  

### Content
The day will be quite loosely planned and we will set the goals in the morning. Be prepared to participate - this is not a workshop, nor a conference. We will be actively working on projects that either contribute to the QGIS Project or to QGIS AU workings - such as building resources (symbology, styles), documentation, QGIS AU website. We will have people mentoring each project to help guide the participants and YES you will learn how to use GitHub! We want to share our knowledge, make connections and up-skill our community.  

If you have an idea to tackle for the day, bring it ready to be worked on - with clear goals and perhaps a breakdown of tasks. Be prepared to instruct attendees on technical processes as well.
