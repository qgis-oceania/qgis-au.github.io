#### Running a local event in your own backyard is good. It builds our QGIS community from the base up by connecting each of us with like-minded people. 

### How do I start?
Just do it. Start small and aim to run multiple events to get the momentum going. Chose a location, perhaps a local cafe, library or university space. Use the microgrants to fund the coffees or some pizzas. You can piggy-back on other events, such as GeoRabbles to find your people. Perhaps do a short presentation at another GIS event about using QGIS and your experience with the community, have a date set up for the next meet-up and publicise it at the end of the event. 

### What will I need
- Work out the type of event
- A venue
- The magical ability to grab peoples attention

#### Type of events
- Informal meeting at a cafe or other venue
- A walking meeting - perhaps take a hike
- Contributors/Working group
- Mapping party (find your local OSM peeps to help you here)

#### Venue
The venue will be guided by the type of event. If you chose a cafe or bar, you can include food as part of the micro-grant. For those events where there is no catering like a library or university, you can use the microgrant to purchase some food or order some pizzas (if its allowed - I mean timtams are a must aren't they?). If you wish to use computers, in addition to somewhere to sit, will you need access to power and wifi?

#### Get people's attention
- Let the community know via the email list - in the subject line, use your location, so like *Grafton QGIS Local Event*.  
- Use the event calender - if you find you cannot add an event, email [QGIS AU](mailto:emma@north-road.com) to provide you access.  
- Send out a notice in the QGIS Happenings - email [QGIS AU](mailto:emma@north-road.com) with the details to be added.  
- Plan out at least a month prior and then email once a week about it. When it gets closer to the event, put out more reminder notifications.

### How will I fund it
OSGeo Oceania has microgrants of $250 available for this very reason: to support our community to grow and connect. Accessing microgrants is as easy as clicking the **Apply for a Grant** button on their [Funding](https://osgeo-oceania.org/funding/) page. 
- Give 14 working days to be successful
- Keep your receipts
- Take photos (please get consent from people in the photos)
- Publicise and don't forget to tag us
- You will be asked to provide a post-event report about the activity, including information on the number of participants and what was achieved.
