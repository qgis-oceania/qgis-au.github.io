# The Organisers
{{< lead >}}
QGIS AU has been around for awhile with 2 official get togethers in Noosa and Sydney. We are all terribly busy so it has been quiet for some time. And sshhh - yes we are QGIS AU - but we welcome all from the region to partake until your own national QGIS comes about.    
If you want to be involved, please let us know via the QGIS AU mailing list or contact us directly.   
**Current coordinator:** emma@north-road.com
