## QGIS Grants - what are they and why do we need them?
This week's story of interest is about [QGIS Grants](https://qgis-australia.org/qgis/qgis-grants/), which are super important for the community to put forward how they want QGIS to develop and get some funding for it. 

## QGIS Podcasts
We have curated a list of [QGIS Podcasts](https://qgis-australia.org/about/qgis-podcasts/) and are keen to hear of any others we can add to this list.
