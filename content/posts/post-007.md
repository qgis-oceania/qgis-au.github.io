## QGIS Workshops at the FOSS4G Oceania Conference
One of the items discussed at the QGIS AU meeting was setting up some QGIS AU reviewed workshops. We think that perhaps if we do this, we can then create a catalogue of well-thought out and suitable workshops that can be delivered on a repeated basis. 

For the upcoming FOSS4G Oceania Conference the following workshop themes are possible options could be suitable. Not all, perhaps, but possibly some would be welcomed by the attendees.
|  Timings  | Cartography |         Analysis         | Field (QField/Mergin) |        Other       |     PostGIS    |
| ------- | --------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
|  **Morning**  |    Intro    |       Model Builder      |   System Administer   |       3D QGIS      |    Advanced    |
| **Afternoon** |   Advanced  | Using the Python Console |          User         | Publish on the web | Set-up locally |

The material perhaps could include:  
- Course preparation instructions
- Course materials
  - Instructions
  - Data
- Powerpoint
- Support links on where to go further. 

If you have any more thoughts, please email the list to start the discussion. We want to get in early for the CFP.

## QGIS Grants - which ones are you keen on?
Head to the [QEP repo](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/labels/Grant-2024) to view them. Add a üëçor a comment to those you think are relevant. 

## QGIS Resource Sharing
We have had our first submission for the styles for QGIS Australia from Shaun who has provided the QPWS qml layers. If you have any other resources you think might be useful, please provide a link to the list. We are currently having some teething problems with the repository, so once it is up and running we will let you know how you can add your resources yourself.

## Newsletter Content
Finding these emails boring and want to contribute some content? You can provide an interest story, a report on an event or a technical instruction. Head to the [Content Contrbution form](https://forms.gle/2DPXq5Y8wqnc7KhS8) to fill in your contribution. We will then contact you to run through the contribution. 

## News from QGIS, OSGeo and FOSS4G Oceania SotM Conference
- Call For Papers will be opening soon for the [FOSS4G Oceania SotM 2024 Hobart conference](https://2024.foss4g-oceania.org/).
- This is a big one, the QGIS mail list is migrating to Discourse and there is currently a discussion about it on the QGIS User email lists. What are your thoughts and experiences? Should we do the same?
