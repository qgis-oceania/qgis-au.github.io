## QGIS AU News
### Admin/Coodination
***Our Coordination strategy is growing!***

We are looking at setting up our own Google workspace to enable coordination of the community. This would give us specific 'QGIS AU' email addresses and room to store our working documents. Int he first instance, we will seek funding from OSGeo Oceania to assist with maintaining it.   

We are also considering separating out the Weekly Newsletter from the QGIS AU Email list through a 'sign-up for the Newsletter' button on the website's homepage. This will enable us to reach the community that are not the on the Email list and for those who wish not to partake in it. This could go towards reserving the QGIS AU email list for dealing with more 2 way communications. We will run the newsletter to be more visually appealing using a service such as MailJet.
