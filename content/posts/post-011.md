## QGIS AU News
Get inspired by the Dutch User Group (see the QGIS Open Day post below) to see how we might run our QGIS Open Day on the Monday at FOSS4G Oceania in Hobart this year. Its more about knowledge exchange. Its an unconference format where they come up with their own agenda on the day and then split into groups. They also had merchandise to celebrate it! For a venue, perhaps we need a classroom environment and then, after the event, move somewhere else for drinks and meals.

- Can't find your data? search online with keywords such as 'rest''services''arcgis' 'your theme'.
  - Go to the website and click at the top of the page until you get 'Home>services'. This will provide you with a lot more folders to search from. 
  - Copy the address and add it to the browser panel under ArcGIS REST Servers
