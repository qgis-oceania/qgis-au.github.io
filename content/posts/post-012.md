### Over the last week or so, whilst travelling and enjoying Wicked the musical, maps were ever present.  
The first, as the stage curtain for Wicked, which helped to set the scene for the ensuing entertainment.

The second was hiking through the area surrounding Mt Barney along Cronin Creek, knowing that my navigation was taken care of All Trails.

How far mapping in daily life has come! Rest assured, I am currently using QGIS to plan my 3 Capes walk to help me understand the elevation, the effort and to look out for special landmarks along the way (still in draft form!).

## QGIS Project News
### QGIS Grants
Ongoing funding for the [QGIS Grants](https://blog.qgis.org/2024/05/08/qgis-grant-programme-2024-update/) may occur thanks to QGIS Denmark and with interest from QGIS Germany. This means that the next QEP on the list, Annonations, will get funding with the possibility that Authenitication may also get some funds.  

So check-out our generous sister QGIS User Group - [QGIS Denmark](https://qgis.dk/). They are a Flagship sponsor of QGIS - this means they contributed €27000 or more.   
This could be partially funded as to be a member of their User Group, requires payment of: 
  - Corporate membership (3500 kr. / year)
  - Personal membership (250 kr. / year)
  - Membership for students, job seekers and pensioners (50 DKK / year)
    
They also run monthly courses with a provider who contributes part of the fee to their user group. 

### QGIS User Conference
There are a couple of people going from our region to the [QGIS User Conference](https://uc2024.qgis.sk/),  9-10 September, Bratislava, Slovakia.  
To give you an idea of the cost: 
- Early bird tickets are €199
- An approximation of flights from Australia may cost around the $3-4k mark
- Accommdation will depend on the style you are chasing

To find out more, check out the [Attending](https://uc2024.qgis.sk/attending/) page for links to accommodation and visa information.

## Algorithms and Geometry
[The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/au) is a great daily read and on the one day they discussed [Why algorithms are call algorithms](https://theconversation.com/why-are-algorithms-called-algorithms-a-brief-history-of-the-persian-polymath-youve-likely-never-heard-of-229286?utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Latest%20from%20The%20Conversation%20for%20May%209%202024%20-%202963830133&utm_content=Latest%20from%20The%20Conversation%20for%20May%209%202024%20-%202963830133+CID_b9882fc100bdbbbdf2365624ef21567c&utm_source=campaign_monitor&utm_term=Why%20are%20algorithms%20called%20algorithms%20A%20brief%20history%20of%20the%20Persian%20polymath%20youve%20likely%20never%20heard%20of) and [Euclid's Geometry](https://theconversation.com/exploring-the-mathematical-universe-connections-contradictions-and-kale-196053) - it was a very good day!
