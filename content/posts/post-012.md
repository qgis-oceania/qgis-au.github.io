### Over the last week or so, whilst travelling and enjoying Wicked the musical, maps were ever present. The first, as the stage curtain for Wicked, which helped to set the scene for the ensuing entertainment. The second was hiking through the area surrounding Mt Barney along Cronin Creek, knowing that my navigation was taken care of All Trails.
