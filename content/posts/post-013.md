### The QGIS Open Day is coming up soon and they need speakers - anyone? Also it may be time to plan your conferences for next year, as well as delve into neo-feaudalism. For our hints, we look at aeronautical maps and old-time land cover symbology.

**QGIS User Conferences**
**2024** - [Bratislava, Slovakia](https://uc2024.qgis.sk/)  
**2025** - Norrk√∂ping Sweden is the official QGIS User Conference in the first week of June. Also if the Auckland FOSS4G bid wins, we can run a QGIS event - I reckon perhaps a day at Waiheke Island at Winery might do the job!  

**Everything Open Conference** - January 2025 Adelaide  
Everything Open is a conference focused on open technologies, including  Linux, open source software, open hardware and open data, and the  communities that surround them. The conference provides technical deep-dives as well as updates  from industry leaders and experts on a wide array of topics from these  areas. It occurs every year and in 2025 it will be held in Adelaide during January - [Subscribe for updates](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/everythingopen/) to keep updated.   

## Neofeudalism: techno-lords and peasants
When you come across those days, when you wonder if OS is worth continuing with, I have a podcast to show how important a role OS software plays in our future. Called [The Philosopher's Zone](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/philosopherszone/neofeudalism-techno-lords-and-peasants/103744328), David Rutledge discuss what could be worse than capitalism with Francis Russell, who describes himself as a philosopher and a unionist.
To see how this plays out fictionally, check out the [Mars Triology](https://www.kimstanleyrobinson.info/content/mars-trilogy) by Kim Stanley Robinson.  

## FOSS4G Story Maps
At FOSS4G SotM Auckland on Community Day we ran a session on what we wanted out of a Digital Story Cartography Product for FOSS4G. Since then we have all gotten busy with our lives, but we did come across Oddyssey, which ABC have picked up and developed a bit more - Check out their [GitHub](https://github.com/abcnews/odyssey)

## Hints and Tips
**Aeronautical maps** - check out Duplex Younkap Nina method on production of aeronautical maps [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/duplex-younkap-nina-engineer_airabrtrafficabrcontrol-asecna-geospatialabrengineering-activity-7198661608997314560-s2hl?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

**Old time land cover patterns**
Evan Applegate has come through with providing a selection of land cover tiles that you can download and use.
