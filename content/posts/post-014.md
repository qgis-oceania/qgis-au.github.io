## EVENTS
### QGIS Open Day
This Friday is QGIS Open Day - tell the community about something awesome you are doing! 
- Meet the developers at Felt as they present their latest version of the 'Add to Felt' plugin.  
- Check out the [QOD Wiki](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/QOD-May-2024) for more information. 

### QGIS...Just the Basics!
One to send out to your peeps that are just getting into QGIS or want to know 'how to QGIS'! Designed for beginners, this session will cover the fundamental concepts of QGIS and how it can be utilized to visualize, analyze, and interpret geospatial data. Sign-up for the [Webinar via Zoom](https://us06web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_Kw9DT8wlSd6yHHvMRxB3cA#/registration).

## QGIS AU User Conference
Monday 4th November, Hobart
We are looking for people for the conference committee. We need to make decisions like what cool merchandise we should get and how we should organise the day and where to go after the day for dinner! Super casual so if you are local, we'd love your help and if you are not local, you can help from afar. Please [email Em](emma@north-road.com) if you would like to help. 

### QGIS Workshops
This year at FOSS4G SotM Oceania, we plan to conduct at least two QGIS workshops on the official workshop day. Additionally, on the day prior, during the QGIS AU User Conference, we will host our own QGIS Hackathon and can include some workshops in that event as well. We might also explore more specialized aspects, such as:  
- Train the Trainer - how to run a training session internally for my organisation or a local session  
- Enterprise QGIS set-up - delivering the perfect QGIS installation and environment to your users  
***So let us know what you would like see delivered on the day via this [QGIS AU User Conference Attendance form](https://forms.gle/s4HRcpN3vTkzRsdHA).***
