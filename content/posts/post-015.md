### QGIS Open Day
 Check out QGIS's flagship sponsor , Felt, presenting ["Add To Felt" at the QGIS Open Day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiW0EsKQVN0&t=124s) 
 
**Has anyone got a great presentation we could put forward for the next open day - you can make it earlier as well so we can all tune in over a beverage on a Friday night. Perhaps a discussion on using QGIS within a Corporate system. We could run it across three presenters. Let us know if you are keen to participate.**

## Styles
Stuck with what color to use in your map? Here is a handy tool called [Coolers](https://coolors.co/).

## Plugins
[Georeferencer Extension](https://github.com/cxcandid/GeorefExtension): creates virtual images (VRT) instead of GeoTIFFs and also lets us crop  the georeferencing result on-the-fly. The main advantage is that with iterative georeferencing, we can  update the already loaded result again and again, as VRT files can be  overwritten. The plugin also allows us to quickly and easily crop  already georeferenced images.   
[ “Add To Felt” QGIS plugin](https://github.com/felt/qgis-plugin) has a new release with a focus on integrating your QGIS styles with Felt. 

## Support Disaster relief mapping
