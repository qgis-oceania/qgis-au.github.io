## Maps and D-Day
Read this [interesting paper](https://geologyglasgow.org.uk/docs/017_283__specialistmapsprepared_1402305576.pdf) on the role of Geologists in D-Day. Like blockbuster movies where the actors get all the accolade, here, the geologist (and cartographers) are but treated like the production crew - the unsung heroes. It bounces around with amazing stories on map numbering, sorucing the data and the images provided are great. This one shows the legend matrix for assessing land to put airfields.

## Hints and Tips
- Geoscience Australia's [Australian Exposure Information Platform](https://www.aeip.ga.gov.au/) (AEIP) to create an exposure report based on themes including agriculture, buildings or environment and where you can pick the hazard and the extent. This then gets emailed to you with a shp, png, excel and geojson. 
- [Python Color Palette Finder](https://python-graph-gallery.com/color-palette-finder/) 2500+ palettes whilst for matplotlib/seaborn - still a great resource for curated palettes when you are need help picking colours. 

## Emergency Mapping
- PNG Landslide
- Kanlaon Volcano eruption in the Philipines
- Rio Grande du Sul floods in Brazil
